# 4*4 grid
# initially 2 random squares are filled with number 2, the rest are empty
# We have to press any one of four keys to move up, down, left, or right. 
# When we press any key, the elements of the cell move in that direction such that if any two identical numbers are contained in that particular row 
# (in case of moving left or right) or column 
# (in case of moving up and down) they get add up and extreme cell in that direction fill itself with that number and rest cells goes empty again.
# After this grid compression, a random square is filled with number 2
